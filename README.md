## CloudMinder Service

Provides a simple REST API to report system uptime and resource status. Used in conjunction with the CloudMinder (Mac only right now) UI to remind the user that their expensive cloud-based node should be shut down.

The service is currently tailored to GCP dataproc nodes.

### Installing

1. clone this repo into your home directory on your dataproc node
2. cd into the CloudMinder directory
3. run the install.sh script
